		 \item Compute shortest paths between slots on $G \rightarrow {SP}_G \subset G$

		\end{itemize}				
				
\textbf{Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
 \item No infinite cycles.
 \item More possible connections - a matter of choice.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Depends on the mesh resolution.

	\begin{itemize}
\item Continuous strategies 
\begin{itemize}
 \item better CF approximation (used methods: Heun or RK4)

 \item depend on proximity parameters and do not always find a valid result

 \item influence of mesh resolution - not obvious
 \end{itemize}
\item Discrete strategy
\begin{itemize}
\item in most cases a result will be found (importance of final choice)

\item depends on the mesh resolution (straightforward influence: higher resolution $\rightarrow$ better approximation)
