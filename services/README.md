#Services module

This module is very peculiar. Unlike others, it does not provide new meshing algorithms
or some key infrastructure concepts that would be used to build algorithms.

Its aim is to expose the algorithms developed in the other modules as a set of services that
could be assembled and composed in a modular way.
