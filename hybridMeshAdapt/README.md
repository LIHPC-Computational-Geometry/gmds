#HybridMeshAdapt module

This module proposes an algorithm to adapt a tetrahedral mesh into an hybrid one using frame fiels and metrics.

To achieve a sufficient level of performances, a mesh data structure dedicated to simplicial meshes is used in this 
component instead of those proposed by the [ig](../ig/README.md) and [kmds](../kmds/README.md) modules.
