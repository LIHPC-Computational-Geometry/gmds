#IGAlgo module

This module provides some basic algorithms for the incidence graph (*ig*) data structure:
- Most important algorithms are relative to retrieving and building some boundary informations: boundaryOperator, boundaryExtractor.
- The *GridBuilder* class provides algoriths to build 2D and 3D structured grids for unit testing purposes mainly.
- The *THexBuilder* create a hexahedral mesh by splitting each tet of an input tetrahedral mesh.
